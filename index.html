<h1><i>Intro to My Life</i></h1>
<h2>By: Miguel Renteria</h2>

<main>
<p>My name is <i>Miguel Renteria</i> I am one of three children of Maria and Miguel Renteria. I have two other brothers and one half sister. My oldest brother is named Omar and my youngest is named Eduardo. I have never met my half sister as she lives in spain with her husband. Her name is Christy. We moved around a lot when I was growing up. We lived in <b><i>Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Mexico City and Las Vegas.</i></b><del> I hated living in Las Vegas.</del> <i>Hate is a strong word so I will say this instead.<b> Once I left I never looked back.</b></i> Las Vegas will always hold a special place in my heart though. Most of my childhood was in Las Vegas and my family and best friends still live there. So even though I say I <i>hate</i> it, I don't really hate it and I go back often. <del>LOL</del></p>
<p>I served in the US ARMY for 4 years. I was part of a special operations unit where our mission was to infiltrate enemy territory and set up for friendly's to have access to the warzone. My tasks and qualifications included:Being Airborne, Air Assault, and being able to clear buildings and large areas</p>
    <p>My most recent accomplishment is being the first of my family to graduate from colleg. <i><b>I graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Best college ever, I had so much fun and made great friends. Oh yeah I also got my degree.</b></i></p>
